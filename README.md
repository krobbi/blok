# About
Blok is an action puzzle game where pieces made of multiple blocks fall onto a
vertical board one at a time. The game is over when a piece can no longer fit
on the board. Points can be scored by filling and clearing a horizontal row of
blocks on the board. The objective of the game is to score as many points as
possible before the game is over.

The game is being implemented and is not yet in a playable state.

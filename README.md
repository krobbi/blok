# About
Blok is an action puzzle game where pieces made of multiple blocks fall onto a
vertical board one at a time. The game is over when a piece can no longer fit
on the board. Points can be scored by filling and clearing a horizontal row of
blocks on the board. The objective of the game is to score as many points as
possible before the game is over.
